# Dwarf_Fotress_Illithids
A repo for a Dwarf Fortress mod featuring illithids
This mod is going well enough for now, special thanks to Legobrick22 for Code and Suggestions, dikbutdagrate for the illithid sprites, McNuggy for the Brainstealer Dragon Sprite, and DPh Kraken for the language file!
This would be impossible without their help.
These Illithid are based off of the source book the Illithiad for the Second Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons

Currently, I rate it Unplyable
Outstanding issues:
Sprites don't work
