# Dwarf_Fotress_Illithids
A repo for a Dwarf Fortress mod featuring illithids
This mod is going well enough for now, special thanks to Legobrick22 for Code and Suggestions, dikbutdagrate for the illithid sprites, McNuggy for the Brainstealer Dragon Sprite, and DPh Kraken for the language file!
This would be impossible without their help.
These Illithid are based off of the source book the Illithiad for the Second Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons

Currently, I rate it Playable, but not perfect

Outstanding issues: N/A
Now its all about Quality baby!

Current Objectives: 
Elder Brain Building- Needs the Sprite and some fancy reactions, already have a few ideas but mostly the building won't be used too often, its just important lore wise
Thralls- Figure out a Thrall System to have slave Dwarves and Humans etc
Sprites- Could probably use new sprites that also include armor and new clothes
