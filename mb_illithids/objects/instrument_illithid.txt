	[DESCRIPTION:The bonethriven consists of a resonance chamber that is surrounded by an enormous assembly of tubes that are carved from the bones of thralls or sometimes animals. It is played by an illithid blowing into the mouth piece while it used its tentacles and fingers in conjunction to open and close a dozen stops. Non-Illithid can play this with great practice, but will never be able to achieve what illithid do. The sound reportedly has a negative effect on non-illithid.]
