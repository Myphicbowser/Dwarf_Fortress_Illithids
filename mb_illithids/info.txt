[DESCRIPTION:The Illithids from the fantastical D&D Universe have been brought to your Dwarf Fortress game!]

[STEAM_TITLE:Illithids]

[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:The Illithids from the D&D universe have been lovingly brought into the universe of Dwarf Fortress, now you TO can commit warcrimes involving brains! I won't spend too long detailing this mod but I will tell you that included with this mod is a Playable Mindflayer Civ, an incredibly dangerous Brainwyrm, and the mighty Ulitharid as a rare caste within the Illithid Kingdoms! Special thanks to DPh Kraken for their work on the Illithid language, dikbutdagrate for the beautiful sprites we're using here, and McNuggy for the Brainwyrm Sprite! This wouldn't be possible without them!

[h1] Castes [/h1]

Currently, there are two castes; Illithid and Ulitharid. Ulitharid are bigger than normal illithids, have a more potent toxin and psionic powers, and are generally more durable and more prone to seeking power. You can idenify them by their two extra ulitharid tentacles, giving them a total of six.

[h1] Penumbra [/h1]

Penumbra, a rare material once used in the construction of the artifical homeworld of the illithid, now smelted by tossing rare materials together in a mysterious way to create metal ready for anything. As heavy as steel and half as sharp as adamantine, Penumbral tools and Armor are one of the best kept secrets of the illithid arsenal, more straightfoward but expensive than steel, you'll need One Gold bar, Two Lead Bars, and Three Iron bars to produce Two Penumbral Bars. This material should be all you need, especially since you can't make steel!

[h1] Differences compared to Dwarves [/h1]

Illithids do /not/ need to be constantly drunk to survive, but can enjoy some relexation time but on the average tend to care about it much less. They are weaker in a few ways, but being as big as humans makes them somewhat more durable. They all have an innate Mindattack, Tentacle Poison, and a Psionic Shield. When it comes to skills specefically, they believe that knowledge is a powerful tool that shouled be utilized at all times, they gain scholarly skills at TWICE the rate of a Dwarf and those skills never rust, by the power of Big Brain!

[h1] The Future [/h1]

Now, eventually I plan on adding the Elder Brain as a member of the Ruling Caste, but that is far off in the future. I also plan on re-visiting my ideas for Ceremorphosis and Slavery/Thralldom in the future. I plan on this mod to develop WITH Dwarf Fortress, not ahead of it, I'm not a good coder after all.]
