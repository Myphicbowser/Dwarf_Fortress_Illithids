[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:The Illithids from the D&D universe have been lovingly brought into the universe of Dwarf Fortress, now you TO can commit warcrimes involving brains! I won't spend too long detailing this mod but I will tell you that included with this mod is a Playable Mindflayer Civ, an incredibly dangerous Brainwyrm, and the mighty Ulitharid as a rare caste within the Illithid Kingdoms! Now, to explain one big difference, due to the technical limitations of DF and the token system, I was unable to create the elder brain and most likely never will as an animal, keep an eye out for a very worm friendly update down the line however as I do have another idea! Special thanks to DPh Kraken for their work on the Illithid language, dikbutdagrate for the beautiful sprites we're using here, and McNuggy for the Brainwyrm Sprite! This wouldn't be possible without them!

When it comes to the ethics of the Mindflayers, they aren't TOO far from dwarves, they don't have a focus on Craftsmanship and don't really need to have time off to drink. They also have a massive focus on Law and Unity and working together and most illithids should want personal power more than Dwarves. Knowledge is the biggest focus for them however, and the Illithid species doesn't lose skills in Knowledge and they also gain knowledge at 1.5x speed, so get those nerds working! When it comes to diplomacy, they're focused on themselves and their body abuse and trophies of other sapient creatures tends to get people mad at them, however they won't make trophies of themselves and all that so they're kinda just supremacists. In all my testing they didn't end up at War as often as I'd like unless it was elves, they really hated the Elves.

Other things to note; Ulitharids are a Rare Caste of Illithid who have a more potent mindblast, psionic shield, and tentacle toxin. Standard Illithids also do have a weak Mindblast, Weak Psionicshield, and a Weak Toxin. Brainwyrms are large predatory Dragons with Tentacle Heads that have an ultra powerful Brainblast, Psionic Shield, and Toxin that Illithid are immune to so its still a huge threat, but less to an Illithid. For now there is Genders on the Illithids, which results in new illithids on migration or trade caravans unequipping everything as a syndrome forces them to the Agender Caste. This was done so they could survive worldgen.]
